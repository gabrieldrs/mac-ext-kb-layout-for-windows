# mac-ext-kb-layout-for-windows
For those that want to switch between win and mac maintaining the same kb layout...

# What it is

A keyboard layout for windows that mimics the default behaviour of key combinations in mac (eg.: `alt+e, e` = `é`, `alt+n, a` = `ã` etc)

# How to use

- Download the zip release
- Extract it somewhere
- Run the setup.exe
- __Restart__ (Important, otherwise it will fail)
- After restart, you will be able to select it from the bottom right corner of the task bar (it will be called "mac-layout")

# Reporting issues

Please, let me know if any key combination doesn't match the one on mac by opening an issue here on github, I created this layout half manually so I may have missed some combinations.

# Additional Information

This keyboard layout was created using "Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4". You can download it from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339.
I also added the installer to this repository, just in case Microsoft decides to remove it from their website
